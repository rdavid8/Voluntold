# Voluntold

This app was created to help people find interesting and fun locations to volunteer based on interest/location.  A simple single-page interactive interface helps smooth the sometimes convoluted process of finding a reputable place to volunteer.  We are utilizing the Yelp api to find the most relevant results.  We then display these results on a large map so that users may see the closest and most relevant places to them.
